*Easiest & Fastest way*
: Using svn, checkout our recent version, currently Ver 1.0 (Sept 20, 2008), following this command:

[Get Talking-Points running using Eclipse]

_svn checkout http://talkingpoints-2.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.0 tts-read-only_

: Main class is located at 'TagReaderTest.Java'.

*Without SVN*
: For whatever reason, if you can't get SVN work, you can go around using this way.

  # Download talkingpoints-1.0-sources.tar.gz
  # Unpack it, and unpack src.tar.gz as well
  # Create lib folder

Now your root folder should look like this
{{{
* tts - src      // every java file should be located here
      - lib      // every supporting library should be located here
      - sounds   // currently, we are using two sounds, 
}}}
